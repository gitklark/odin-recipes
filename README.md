Practicing HTML by creating webpages describing cooking recipes and then linking them to index.html.

Step by Step Process:
-I created an index.html file for my main-page and then a recipes folder where I stored my recipe pages.  
-I created an HTML boilerplate for the index and all recipe files.
-Once I finished writing up my recipe files, I made a link to all of them separately on my index file.
-I then pushed everything to github after adding and committing a few times beforehand.
